Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository is a submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course by Renee Marina. 
It contains the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.

Dataset used

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files included

A. CodeBook.md : a code book that indicates all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

B. run_analysis.R script then reads and converts data followed by the 5 steps required by the course project:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Final data is exported as tidy_data.txt.
